== Cinux Shell 0.1 ==

Cinux Shell is a graphical shell for the web, a full screen web browser for devices that don't need a desktop.

The code is designed to be run using Mozilla Chromeless [2] and currently lives on the Cinux web site.

To run, check out Chromeless from github [4] and execute... 

  $ ./chromeless /path/to/shell/

...from the Chromeless source directory.
